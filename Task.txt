Description :

    Implement the Open Brewery API using async/await with fetch.

Constraints:

    * All your HTML elements should be created with DOM.
    * Use the async/await.
    * Use try-catch to handle errors.
    * Use fetch() to get the data from Open Brewery API
    * All JavaScript codes should be in a script file named script.js which has to be imported in your HTML page.
    * Implement a search filter based on the text entered in the input field.

How do I process the API data?

    * Display the breweries name and type.
    * Display the brewery’s address.
    * Also display the website url.
    * Display the phone no of the brewery.
